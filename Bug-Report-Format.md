# Bug Bounty Report Format

- Title
  
  - The title is the first thing a security engineer sees, and it sets the tone for the entire report.
  - Keep it short and clear â€” describe what functionality was exploited or which security mechanism was bypassed.
  - If possible, include the potential impact directly in the title for quick context.
 
- Description

  - Use this section to explain the vulnerability in detail.
  - Describe what the issue is, where it occurs, and what triggered it during your testing.
  - Mention any relevant endpoints, paths, error messages, or unexpected behaviors. You can also include related HTTP requests or snippets of vulnerable code if applicable.
 
- Steps to Reproduce

  - List the exact steps required to reproduce the issue from scratch.
  - Make sure each step is easy to follow so that the security team can verify and understand the vulnerability clearly.
  - A well-documented process helps speed up triage and resolution.
 
- Proof of Concept (PoC)

  - This section demonstrates the issue visually or practically. Include screenshots, request logs, or a short video to show how the vulnerability can be triggered or exploited. The goal is to give a clear, undeniable demonstration of the bug in action.
 
- Impact

  - Explain what an attacker could achieve if this vulnerability were exploited in the real world.
  - Focus on actual consequences like what possible damages could be done, rather than theoretical scenarios.
  - Should align with the business objective of the organization
